# WeatherDashboard
Do you ever feel like traveling to a beach or a different city but you just aren't sure how the weather is going to be? Well my weather dashboard will be your best friend. You can enter in a location and it will give you current weather for it including tempature, humidity, windspeed, and uv index. On top of that if gives you a 5 day forecast with the dates the tempature, humidity and a picture of the weather. You can look at your previous searches and even click on them to go back to that data. And finally when you load the page back up the last search you input will display with all of its data!
